# Custom-icons
Several legacy icons and icons collected all over the internet in 1 set, UI selectable

Upon each [Material Design icons](http://materialdesignicons.com) update to HA, icons tend to be deprecated, and every now and then I'd love to keep using some. Branded icons, or legacy models. 
Several icons by the Frontend magician [Matt8707](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config) are listed, and I've also found use for the finer grained Shutter icons by [g-kiss](https://github.com/g-kiss/Home-Assistant-custom-shutter-icons), but needed them in another format.

Structure of the file copied from the great and appreciated [Hass Hue Icon](https://github.com/arallsopp/hass-hue-icons) repo by @arallsopp who should recieve all the credits and without whom the HA interface would be the same ;-)

Thanks to all!
